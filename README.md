# Blue-Prince-Vault
Backup of my Blue Prince Obsidian Vault.

Essentially a collection of Markdown files and images detailing everything that I've uncovered so far in Blue Prince. I expect that it is not comprehensive, but it is what I have so far. If you have gotten to a point where you're looking for things you may have missed, feel free to take a stroll through and see if it is helpful or makes sense to you.

WARNING: Contains massive spoilers. Do not even poke around in here if you're concerned about spoiling puzzles or story elements.
