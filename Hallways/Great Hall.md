A room of many doors and even more choices. The Great Hall is unquestionably the largest hallway of the house but is also the least useful, for the doors "lining" its walls are always locked. Perhaps for a reason.

- Lever that opens the East side of the [[Antechamber]] is behind one of the doors
  *If you have a metal detector, the lever is typically in the same room with metallic loot (usually [[Keys]] or [[Gold]])*
- One door contains an [[Upgrade Disk]]
- No special results for unlocking all doors on the same day
