Setup
1. Power the [[Pump Room]] using either the [[Boiler Room]] or the Electric Eel [[Aquarium]] upgrade.
2. Move the water around so that the [[Reservoir]] can be completely drained.
3. Use the [[Power Hammer]] to open the Secret Passage to the [[Basement]] from [[The Grounds]]
4. Open the black [[Locked Trunk]] behind the large stone in the middle of the bottom area that has a [[Sanctum Key]] in it.

Process
1. On days when you draft the [[Trading Post]] as your [[Outer Rooms]], go down and pick up the [[Sanctum Key]] from the [[Reservoir]].
2. Trade it in to the [[Trading Post]] for either an [[Upgrade Disk]] or an [[Allowance Token]]

3. If you have [[Blackbridge Grotto]] unlocked, you can use the [[Upgrade Disk]] at the [[Computer Terminal]] there instead of hoping to Draft a room with one in the house.

*This can be repeated indefinitely as the [[Sanctum Key]] will respawn after you __Call it a Day__.*
