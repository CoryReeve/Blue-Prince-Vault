__*Conditions:*__
- Triggering experiments setup in the [[Laboratory]] raises the Radiation Levels on the Estate.
- When Radiation Levels get high enough (4 or more Successful Triggers), all normal doors in the Estate will be unlocked.

Setup Options:
(Without [[Blackbridge Grotto]] unlocked)
1. Draft [[Shelter]] as your [[Outer Room]]
2. Go inside and access the [[Computer Terminal]]. Just to make sure it's online.
3. Draft the [[Laboratory]] in the Estate
4. Setup an experiment that you can trigger at least 4 times
5. Once you have triggered the experiment 4 times, use any [[Computer Terminal]] you have available. Login to the Network and use the Network Connection to access the [[Shelter]] computer.
6. Use the Main Menu of the Shelter computer to take a Radiation Reading. All doors will unlock.

If you have [[Blackbridge Grotto]] unlocked, you do not need to draft [[Shelter]] to enact The Nuclear Option. Simply use the Shelter as your daily "Offline Connection" provided by the Grotto.

If you have drafted Shelter at the beginning of the day, you can use the "Offline Connection" to access the Laboratory before you've drafted it. This allows you to get started immediately if you roll a favorable Experiment.
