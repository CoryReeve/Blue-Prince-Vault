Unsurprisingly, Key 8 unlocked a door leading to a familiar looking room, a cryptic room that had been previewed in the final 8-letter artwork exhibited in the Gallery. It is now time to ruminate over the bins, sins, and pins contained within.

| __Bin__ | __Animal Statue__ |
| :----: | :----: |
| Hubris | Monkey |
| Envy | Lion |
| Lust | Swan|
| Wrath | Elephant |
| Gluttony | Penguin |
| Sloth | Bear |
| Avarice | Rabbit |
| Mundanity | Dog |
Solving the puzzle for the first time unlocks the Infinity Trophy and 2 [[Allowance Token]]
